Welcome to Linux4Jamaica, a proudly American organization dedicated to bridging the digital divide by upcycling expired Chromebooks in the United States and distributing them to schools in Jamaica.

Chromebooks used in the American education system have a built-in "death date" after which software support ends. These computers are often rendered unusable to anybody without a high degree of technical expertise. The 1 million Chromebooks purchased globally in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic represent approximately 9 million tons of CO2e emissions. Doubling the life of Chromebooks sold in 2020 could cut emissions equivalent to taking 900,000 cars off the road for a year.

At Linux4Jamaica, we address these issues by upcycling expired Chromebooks and refurbishing them with open-source, state-of-the-art Linux operating systems. This not only extends the useful life of these devices but also ensures that they are secure and stable for long-term use in a classroom setting.

We believe in the power of technology to transform lives and communities. We are proud to play a small but important role in bridging the digital divide and creating a more equitable future for all. By promoting the use of open source software, we hope to provide a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to proprietary software.
