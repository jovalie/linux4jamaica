Welcome to Linux4Jamaica, an American organization dedicated to bridging the digital divide by upcycling expired Chromebooks in the United States and distributing them to schools in Jamaica.

Chromebooks used in the American education system have a built-in "expiration date". These computers are often rendered unusable to anybody without a high degree of technical expertise. 1 million Chromebooks were purchased globally in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, many which will expire within 4 years. If the lifespan of the Chromebooks sold in 2020 (approximately 31.8 million) was doubled, it could result in a reduction of 4.6 million tons of CO2e emissions, which is equivalent to removing 900,000 cars from the road for a year.

At Linux4Jamaica, we address these environmental and social issues by upcycling expired Chromebooks and refurbishing them with open-source, state-of-the-art Linux operating systems. This not only extends the useful life of these devices but also ensures that they are secure and stable for long-term use in a classroom setting. This method also provides an opportunity for American and Jamaican students to experience to the growing field of computer repair and engineering in the form of student internships.

We believe in the power of technology to transform lives and communities. We are proud to play a small but important role in bridging the digital divide and creating a more equitable future for all. By promoting the use of open source software, we hope to provide a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to proprietary software.
